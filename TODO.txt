Here are the tasks we need to get done so far:
	- Console Animation
		- Requires setting a size and creating code to develop an FPS on the console
		- 11 FPS
		- I think a set size would be easier to implement across computers

	- Capturing Keycodes
		- We need to be able to read keys in the console without using Console.Readline. It has to be real time.

	- ???
